# Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations Practicum

This repository contains the completed practicum project for the **Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations** certification. This app demonstrates my ability to create a Node.js integration with HubSpot's CRM API using a custom object.

## ðŸ§  What the Project Does

This Node.js app:

- Uses Express, Axios, and Pug
- Connects to a HubSpot Developer Test Account
- Defines a custom object (`Plants`) with properties:
  - `name` (string)
  - `species` (string)
  - `description` (string)
- Displays all records in a table (via `/`)
- Provides a form to add new records (via `/update-cobj`)
- Uses the HubSpot API to fetch and create records dynamically
